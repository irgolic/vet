## Audit file (`audits.toml`)

Holds the audit records for packages in this project. 
Each record contains:
- `who` performed the audit,
- `status` of the audit (unsafe, safe to run, safe to deploy),
- `version` of the package that was audited.
- `notes` (optionally) about the audit.

Example:
```toml
[audits.example_package]
who = "Example Person <person@example.com>"
status = "safe to deploy"  # or "safe to run" or "unsafe"
version = "1.7.2"
notes = "Some notes about the audit"
```

## Config file (`config.toml`)

### Exemptions

A list of packages that are exempt from audits. 
For sake of ease of getting started, all packages in the `poetry.lock` file are exempt by default.
These packages should be audited either manually or via import of an audit from a trusted source.

Example:
```toml
[exemptions.example_package]
version = "1.7.2"
status = "safe to deploy"
```

### Imports

A list of URLs to audit sources. 
Each source must provide a TOML file with audits (same as `audits.toml`).

Example:
```toml
[imports.example_org]
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/example_org/example_project/main/chain-of-trust/audits.toml"
```

## Import lock (`import.lock`)

This file is automatically generated by `vet`. 
Do not edit it manually.

It holds a local copy of audits from trusted sources specified in the config file.
